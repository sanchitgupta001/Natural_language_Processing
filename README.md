# Natural_language_Processing

This repository contains basic tutorial for natural language processing using Python3

Steps which need to be followed before you proceed:

1. pip3 install nltk (If using windows, I would recommend using anaconda ..... Then, you need to run: (conda install nltk) on command   prompt(Run Command prompt as an administrator)) 

2. Create a python file and execute:
   import nltk
   nltk.download() # GUI would appear and then choose the desired packages to download from the list of packages
   #nltk.download('all') # For downloading all the packages in one go (GUI would not appear)  
   
3. After following the above two steps, you may proceed towards coding using Natural Language Tool Kit (nltk).

Happy Coding ! :)
